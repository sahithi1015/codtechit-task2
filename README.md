OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT:SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

OBJECTIVE:

The goal of this project is to implement a simple linear regression model to predict a continuous target variable based on a single predictor variable. We'll train the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.

##Steps:

##Import Necessary Libraries

-We import essential libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to handle data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

##Load and Prepare the Dataset

-For simplicity, we generate a synthetic dataset using numpy where the predictor variable X and the target variable y have a known linear relationship with added noise.
Split the Dataset

-We split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

##Train the Linear Regression Model

-We create and train a linear regression model using LinearRegression from scikit-learn.

##Evaluate the Model's Performance

-We make predictions on both the training and testing sets.

-We compute evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess the model's performance.

##Visualize the Results

##We create visualizations to understand the model's performance better:

-A plot of the regression line against the actual data points.

-A plot of actual vs. predicted values to see how well the model's predictions match the actual values.
